dist
====

A play project around distributed computation and asyncio

Pieces
------

*  MDStore: A lightweight redis.  Maps between workers and data
*  Worker: A system that can execute jobs, store data, and communicate with
   other workers

Disclaimer
----------

This is a weekend project, my first attempt at asyncio, and not for public use.
